				<p> What is the place of textuality in feminist criticism? (I mean criticism both in
					the narrow sense of literary criticism and in the broad sense of sociocultural
					critique.) Since textual analysis has a fundamental place in any theory of
					culture, how should the feminist critic approach her work with texts? What
					should her purpose be? I am not sure that a theory of womenâs writing is useful
					or even desirable at this point. Because women have been a colonized population
					for so long, I fear that any critical category we may find applicable today is
					likely to be derived from or imbued with male ideologies. As writers, critics,
					teachers, we know this from our daily experiences. I am not suggesting that we
					ought to clean the slate of history and start anew because I am enough of a
					historical materialist and semiotician that I cannot conceive of a totally new
					world rising out of, and in no way connected with, the past or the present. I
					believe neither in utopias nor in the myth of Paradise Now, or ever. What I am
					suggesting is that theory is dialectically built on, checked against, modified
					by, transformed along with, practiceâthat is to say, with what women do, invent,
					perform, produce, concretely and not âfor all timeâ but within specific
					historical and cultural conditions.</p>
				<p> In the summer of 1975, I was in the small town of <placeName
						key="Santarcangelo di Romagna" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q111954"
						cert="high">Santarcangelo di Romagna<precision match="@ref" precision="high"
						/></placeName> (near <placeName key="Bologna"
						ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1891">Bologna, Italy</placeName>) where
					an open-air theater festival sponsored performances by militant and experimental
					groups in the town square and courtyards of two medieval castles. One of these
					performances attracted my attention by its title, <title>Nonostante Gramsci
						(Despite Gramsci)</title>. It was performed by a militant feminist
					collective, <orgName>La Maddalena</orgName>, based in <placeName key="Rome"
						ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q220" cert="high">Rome<precision
							match="@ref" precision="high"/></placeName>. <persName
						key="Antonio Gramsci" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q83003">Antonio
						Gramsci</persName> was founder of the <orgName key="Italian Communist Party"
						ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q461886" cert="high">Italian Communist
						Party</orgName> (PCI) and one of the major European Marxist thinkers. He was
					the most important influence on the Italian left in general and on the politics
					of the Italian Communist Party in particular. His historical analyses and
					theoretical foundations for Italian communism continue to be effective
					today.</p>
				<p> Gramsci was imprisoned in 1926 by the newly consolidated Fascist dictatorship.
					He received a mock trial, was given a life sentence, and died in 1937 of illness
					and abuse suffered in one of <persName key="Benito Mussolini"
						ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q23559" cert="high" type="real"
						>Mussoliniâs</persName> prisons. The circumstances of his death and his
					extraordinary intellectual and moral stature have made him perhaps the greatest
					hero and martyr of the Italian resistance. This is why the playâs title, Despite
					(or Notwithstanding) Gramsci, surprised and intrigued me, since I knew that
					Italian feminist groups consist almost exclusively of women with a record of
					militancy in the left. They couldnât be "against" Gramsci. Therefore, what did
					they mean by "despite"?</p>
				<p> The background of the production reveals the groupâs ideological stance. Both
					the text of the theatrical production and the underlying research on original
					documents were published together the following year under the editorship of
						<persName key="Adele Cambria" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3605177"
						>Adele Cambria</persName>, a feminist writer and one of the editors of the
					major Italian feminist monthly <title key="Effe"
						ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q28136179">EFFE</title>.<note n="1"
						type="scholarNote">Adele Cambria, Amore come rivoluzione (Milano: Sugar Co.,
						1976): The volume includes the script and production notes for Nonostante
						Gramsci.</note> Cambria formulated and conducted the research, but the
					theatrical work was performed, directed and written collectively. The published
					volume, entitled <title>Amore come rivoluzione (Love as Revolution)</title>
					contains I believe not two textsâone creative/artistic and one
					historical/biographicalâbut rather a single text. It self-consciously attempts
					to be at once historical and artistic, and deliberately presents itself as
					tendentious and critical. It is a text with its ideology clearly stated and with
					a basis of original research behind its fiction. This text is posited as a set
					of questions dealing with love and revolutionâa complex problem that emerged in
					the late 1960s, was pushed to the foreground of political consciousness by
					radical feminism, and is one of the major issues in revolutionary politics
					today.</p>
				<p> During the last eleven years of his life, the imprisoned Gramsci wrote the bulk
					of his theoretical work now published as Quaderni dal carcere (<title
						key="Prison Notebooks" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1113267"
						level="j">Prison Notebooks</title>)<note n="2" type="scholarNote">The
						complete Italian edition, in four volumes, is Antonio Gramsci, Quaderni dal
						carcere, a cura di Valentino Gerratana (Torino: Einaudi, 1975). In English
						see Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci, edited and
						translated by Quintin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell Smith (New York:
						International Publishers, 1971).</note> In 1922 Gramsci spent several months
					in the Soviet Union as Italian envoy to the Executive Committee of the Communist
					International. While hospitalized in a sanatorium outside Moscow, he met Eugenia
					Schucht, also a patient in the hospital, and her sister Giulia. Giulia and
					Antonio fell in love. After Gramsci had returned to Western Europe, recalled by
					his political duties, their son Delio was born in 1924. The couple were together
					only once again, the following year, when Giulia, the baby and Eugenia spent a
					few months in Rome with Gramsci who by then had been elected to the Italian
					parliament. When she returned to the Soviet Union, Giulia was pregnant with
					their second son, Giuliano, whom Gramsci never saw. History records that during
					his long years in prison, the only link between Gramsci and his family was
					Giulia's other sister, <persName key="Tat'jana Apollovna Å ucht"
						ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q107987130">Tatiana Schucht</persName>,
					who lived in Italy and followed Gramsci as he was sent from one jail to another.
					She supported him materially and spiritually, assisting him through his long
					agony. It is Tatiana who rescued Gramsciâs Prison Notebooks after his death.
					But, history being the history of men, only Gramsciâs letters were deemed
					important historical documents.<note n="3" type="scholarNote">Antonio Gramsci,
						Lettere dal carcere, a cura di S. Caprioglio e E. Fubini (Torino: Einaudi,
						1973). In English see Antonio Gramsci, Letters from Prison, selected and
						translated by Lynne Lawner (New York: Harper and Row, 1973). See also
						Guiseppe Fiori, Antonio Gramsci: Life of a Revolutionary (New York: Schocken
						Books, 1973).</note> The letters he received from Giulia and Tatiana were
					not published, although they existed, lying in a file at the Gramsci Institute
					in Rome. Official historiographyÂ scorned them. They were women's letters,
					dealing "only with children and marmalade," banal, insignificant. Little
					information could be found about these mute women, whose complex relationships
					to Gramsci and to one another constituted the most intense private aspect of
					Gramsciâs life as a revolutionary. Biographers record that Giulia grew more and
					more alienated from her husband as a result of mental illness. In his letters he
					lamented and grieved over her silence. Tatiana acted as a sister of mercy,
					visiting Gramsci in jail, sending him socks and medicines, relaying lettersÂ <pb

						xml:space="default" n="24"/> between him, Giulia and the children. Here ends
					their official history. Yet, if we read Gramsciâs letters many of the questions
					posed in them remain unanswered: What exactly was the nature of Giuliaâs
					âillnessâ? Why did Tatiana and not she stay in Italy to assist him in jail? What
					moved Tatiana to literally devote her life to him? What was Eugeniaâs role?
					There is no doubt that Gramsciâs thoughts were directed to these private
					concerns as much as to political problems and theoryâhis letters prove it
					despite the self-restraint imposed by personal ethics and prison censorship.
					Some of his most beautiful letters to Giulia deal with the education of their
					children and with the problems posed by his responsibilities to the revolution
					and to their love relationshipâhe even suggested a formal separation that would
					allow Giulia to re-marry, if that would restore her well-being.</p>
				<p> Who were these women outside of the pale, pathetic hagiography constructed by
					Gramsciâs biographers? This is what Adele Cambria set out to investigate. She
					carefully read all of the womenâs letters in conjunction with Gramsciâs,
					interviewed people who had been close friends of the sisters, studied Eugeniaâs
					letters to a friend in Rome and the notebooks in which Giulia had practiced
					compositions as an adolescent. Cambria's purpose throughout was to reconstruct
					an âaffective biographyâ of the Schuchts and to discover the sources and modes
					of that âemotional energyâ <persName key="Shulamith Firestone"

					identifies as the essential female contribution to male thought.<note n="4"
						type="scholarNote">The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution
						(New York: Bantam Books, 1970), pp. 126-127.</note> Cambriaâs project was a
					political one: to rewrite history, inscribing in it the missing voices of women,
					and therefore to examine the relationships between the private and the public,
					love and revolution, personal/sexual/emotional needs and political
					militancyârelations which she sees as the moving forces of all revolutionary
					struggle. In restoring to Gramsciâs epistolary monologue its real nature as
					dialogue, Cambria adds depth to the cultural image of a person whose complex
					humanity has been expediently stereotyped.</p>
				<p>In a letter to Giulia in 1924, before his imprisonment and at the height of
					revolutionary activities Gramsci himself posed the problem. He wrote:</p>
				<quote>How many times have I asked myself whether it was possible to tie oneself to
					a mass without ever having loved anyone .. whether one could love a collectivity
					if one hadnât deeply loved some single human beings . . . Wouldnât this have
					made barren my qualities as a revolutionary, wouldnât it have reduced them to a
					pure intellectual fact, a pure mathematical calculation? <note n="5"
						type="scholarNote">5. Quoted by Cambria, p. 9, from Duemila pagine di
						Gramsci (Milano: Il Saggiatore), Vol. II, p. 23, letter of June 9, 1924; my
						translation.</note></quote>
				<p> Gramsciâs question unwinds the ideological thread that runs through Cambriaâs
					work and the collective theater production, both of which focus on the "private
					aspect" of Gramsciâs life. Thus an understanding of the Schucht family is
					essential, in the context of the turn-of-the-century cultural values and of the
					changes brought by the October Revolution. <persName key="Vladimir Lenin"

				<p>Apollo Schucht, father of the three sisters, was an exile from czarist Russia who
					had settled in Rome in 1908. Born into the upper bourgeoisie, he had belonged to
					the Russian populist social reform movement<note type="researchNote">Political
						stance that emphasizes the ideas, wants, needs of the people. </note>
						(<lang>narodvolcstvo</lang>) in the mid-nineteenth century. Deported with
					Lenin to Siberia where his third daughter, Eugenia, was born, he asked his
					friend Lenin to be her "godfather." The family lived in Rome from 1908 to 1917.
					After the October Revolution, they all returned to the Soviet Union and worked
					in the CPSU except Tatiana who stayed at her teaching position in Rome.
					Significantly nothing much is known of Apollo's wife, Lula, except that she was
					an excellent cook and housewife. It was Apollo's strong influence that shaped
					the lives of his daughters. His worldview, in matters of sex roles, was all but
					revolutionary. His daughters completed their higher education in Rome in the
					arts and natural sciences, areas that clearly trained women for the only careers
					suitable for them â marriage and teaching. The early writings of Giulia and
					Eugenia reveal how deeply the had absorbed their father's late-romantic
					humanitarian values: a sense of duty toward the poor and dispossessed; contact
					with nature as a source of happiness, goodness and personal fulfillment; the
					love of children idealized as a pure unspoiled manifestation of Good Nature; a
					sentimental attachment to Family as nest and shelter from the disorder and
					potential danger of the outside world. None of this prepared them for the
					violent realities in which they were to live. In the turmoil after the
					revolution there came into their lives the man who, like their father before
					him, was to magnitize their existence. Gramsci became, for all three women, the
					center of their emotional world, the pivot of a patriarchal modelÂ they had
					deeply internalized. They all were in love with Antonio.</p>
				<p/>
				<p> Eugenia met him first, but he fell in love with Giulia, the youngest, most
					beautiful and most âfeminineâ of them. Cambria documents, fairly convincingly,
					that Eugeniaâs espousal of the Communist causeâher âweddingâ to the Party âcame
					right after Antonio and Giulia met. The sistersâ close mother-daughter
					relationship had made Giulia emotionally and intellectually dependent on her
					older sister. Eugenia later exploited this by making herself indispensable,
					supporting her financially, taking care of her children and living with her
					before and during Gramsciâs imprisonment, thus reinforcing Giuliaâs feelings of
					personal inadequacy in the roles of mother and wife. In Cambriaâs
					interpretation, Eugenia was mainly responsible for keeping Giulia away from
					Gramsci. Her reasons were consistent with the prevailing values of the time:
					Giulia must stay in the Soviet Union to care for the children who would be in
					great danger in Fascist Italy; Giulia was âsickly and subject to depressionsâ;
					Giulia was a Soviet communist and the Party needed her. Eradicating from her
					life the possibility of a "private relationship" with any man, Eugenia played
					the male role as political activist and head of the household. While praising
					and mythicizing Gramsci as a revolutionary leader (she translated his writings
					for the Soviet workers), Eugenia increased the human distance between him and
					Giulia.</p>
				<p> Tatiana met Antonio after his return to Rome, already married to Giulia
					(officially recorded after the first child was born). Tatianaâs love for
					Gramsci, avowed as sisterly love, developed over the twelve years during which
					she performed for him the duties of the prisonerâs wife. A close reading of
					their letters shows the ambivalence of their relationship which, considering
					their strong ethical sense and material and social constraints, was perhaps the
					most fulfilling, if deformed, love relationship of any of the Schucht sisters.
					In defining herself as Giuliaâs representative, she slowly made herself
					indispensable to the man she loved. She maintained contact with underground left
					leaders outside Italy in hopeless attempts to free Gramsci through prisoner
					exchanges. As the only correspondent authorized by jail officials, she copied
					and relayed his letters to Giulia and the children and theirs to him. By this
					âcharitable sacrificeâ and sisterly devotion, and by never allowing her own
					needs to surface (but they are there, between the lines of the letters), Tatiana
					gradually acquired a wifeâs right to husbandly gratitude, a wifely
					possessiveness and the subtle power gained by female self- denial.</p>
				<p> Of the three stories, unrecorded by history, Giuliaâs is the most lonely. She is
					still alive, as far as we know, in some psychiatric hospital where she has spent
					most of her life, imprisoned in her âmental illnessâ as Antonio was in his cell.

						n="25"/> He burned in the hell of pain, captivity and death, but he wonâhe
					is a protagonist of history. Giulia is still burning, quietly, bothering no one,
					unnoticed, useless. One of Cambriaâs most significant contributions to feminist
					analysis is her effort to understand Giuliaâs personal world with love and
					generosity, outside of myth and without mystification. She sees Giulia as a
					sensitive, intelligent, gifted woman in whom the traditional female
					socialization, with its emphasis on dependence, frailty and childlike trust,
					found a most receptive terrain. Giulia did not relate intellectually to others
					or to her own experience. Women of her time were not supposed to. She needed
					direct sensuous contact with reality, her children, her man. She gave up her
					violin for her children and the Party. The distance between her and Antonio was
					caused not only by circumstances but also by decisions made for her by EugeniÄ,
					to which Gramsci acquiesced. Her response to the distance was expressed by a
					sense of personal inadequacy, increasing depression, surrendering her will to
					others and to the mechanical details of daily existence. The notion that absence
					makes the heart grow fonder did not work for her: she blamed herself for not
					being able to feel, for losing contact with Antonio who was becoming a mere
					abstractionâThe Father of Her Children, The Revolutionary Heroâno longer her
					lover whom she could touch nor her friend whom she could see and hear and speak
					to. She felt guilty about this and when she finally dared to write to him about
					her illness he did not answer, could not accept the idea of mental illness,
					spoke harshly of psychoanalysis as a crutch, and like the rest of the family
					recommended iron, vitamins and willpower. No one ever seriously considered the
					possibility that Giulia move to Italy to assist Antonio, and she herself
					believed that she could never do for him what Tatiana did. In short, Eugenia and
					Tatiana usurped her roles as mother, housekeeper and wife and effectively
					deprived her of meaningful emotional relationships and intensified her sense of
					powerlessness. At last, Cambria maintains, Giuliaâs inability to define herself
					conceptually or through any type of personal power, and the unreality of her
					existence that could not function within any socially accepted mode of female
					behavior, pushed Giulia to live her rebellion inwardly, in total passivity. This
					is precisely what is often diagnosed as madness in women.<note n="6"

				<p> In a sense, the personalities and social roles assumed by the three Schucht
					sisters sketch almost to a T the only choices allowed women in most Western
					cultures: service functions within male structures, adherence to the feminine
					mystiqueÂ of charity, sacrifice and self-denial, and madness. The textual
					strategies of Amore come rivoluzione are the result of ideological choices. The
					materials being mainly letters, there were three obvious genre possibilities:
					(1) publishing the letters, with some editing (as was done with Gramsci's
					letters); (2) putting together a sort of three-way epistolary novel of Giulia's,
					Tatiana's and Gramsci's letters; or (3) giving the materials a narrative form,
					i.e., writing a biography of the Schucht sisters. Cambria discarded all three
					alternatives. Her decision to avoid a ânovelisticâ organization was a political
					as well as aesthetic choice: as recent critical theory in literature and film
					argues, narrative form is the primary aesthetic code developed to convey
					bourgeois and counter-revolutionary values.<note n="7" type="scholarNote">7.
						From Umberto Eco, Opera aperta (Milano: Bompiani, 1967) to Stephen Heath,
						âNarrative Space,â Screen (Autumn 1976), pp. 68-112.</note> Simply printing
					the letters without attempting to reproduce such âphysicalâ qualities as hand
					writing, or the context in which they were written and discovered, would have
					erased altogether the function of the subject (Cambria herself), as both writer
					and narrator of her book and at the same time reader of the Schucht letters.</p>
				<p> Cambria chose to print portions of the original documents in italics
					interspersed with passages from Gramsciâs letters, quotations, statements by
					friends or others involved in the events, while her own comments link, interpret
					and contextualize each passage. The rigorous separation, by different typefaces,
					between the womenâs letters and her own commentary explicitly manifests the
					interpretive nature of the commentary, its tendentiousness, its having a
					viewpoint, its being âsectarianâ rather than an innocent or âobjectiveâ
					explanation. In this manner, a twofold process is set in motion in the text: the
					release of affective energies contained in the firsthand documents, which were
					personal writings aimed at a real person (Gramsci), not a literary readership;
					and the release of a corresponding emotional response in the modern woman
					reading the letters and mediating them for us through her personal and
					ideological, affective and conceptual codes. In many passages Cambria shares her
					emotion at discovering the letters, looking at the faded colors of the paper,
					the elegant old-fashioned handwriting of Tatiana, the broken sentences and
					pencil scrawls of an already ill Giulia. Cambria also describes her feelings as
					she approached the Moscow house where Giulia lived and where Cambria interviewed
					her son Giuliano.<note n="8" type="scholarNote">8. On the conditions of women in
						the Soviet Union since the revolution, see Sheila Rowbotham, âIf You Like
						Tobogganingâ in her Women, Resistance and Revolution (New York: Vintage

				<p> Cambria conveys to readers how she absorbed Giulia, Tatiana and Eugenia as
					fragments of her own self, how their experiences can act as reactor to other
					womenâs understanding of themselves; she also conveys her elation in discovering
					and unearthing a writing which is the testimony of unknown women. She reaches
					into an immense reservoir of womenâs folklore, millions of letters in which
					women have spent their imagination and creativity writing to those they loved,
					all lost, but for the few who made literary history by loving a male
					protagonist.</p>
				<p> The performance I saw was in an open courtyard and used the <persName
						key="Brechtian Methodology in Wiseâs The Sound of Music: Insights into Theatre in Education"
						ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q96579994">Brechtian</persName> concept
					of epic theater. In the theatrical text, the double function of the subject as
					writer and as reader is dramatized in the character of The Girl, epic narrator
					and didactic commentator, who circulates among the four characters (the three
					sisters and Gramsci), each of whom is confined to an assigned scenic space. The
					Girl has a double function: as narrator and commentator, she provides the
					historical background and the feminist interpretation of the performed action.
					As character, she voices the lyrical consciousness of the play, Woman-<persName
						key="Orpheus" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q174353" cert="high"
						type="real">Orpheus</persName>. A contemporary woman, she is a barometer for
					the audience, reacting with pity and anger to the events enacted around her. The
					fact that she also acts visibly as a stage hand (she projects the slides, moves
					the structures, dresses the actors) is a brilliant theatrical idea for she is
					perceived by the audience as a performer, i.e., as a real person participating
					in the entire fictional creation and not simply acting out a memorized part in
					somebody elseâs play. Furthermore, since she models audience response, it is
					very important that she does not remain emotionally detached or objective in
					relation to the characters; at the same time her involvement must never become
					total. For, in the intentions of the epic theater, the audience and the
					performers must not identify totally with the characters, must not be drawn into
					the story forgetting that it is a fiction, must not experience catharsis at the
					conclusion of the play. Rather, they must remain conscious of the problems
					raised by the play and seek their solution outside, after the play, in the real
					world. One example: in âdressingâ Giulia, revealing her to us, The Girl is a
					woman of today discovering her roots in a woman of the past and re-enacting
					herself in a fictional character. But when The Girl acts out the pain of
					pregnancy and childbirth, shouting her rejection of motherhood as a physical
					violence done to her body, as an emotionally traumatic infringement on her total
					person, at this moment The Girl is Giulia; she expresses the feeling that Giulia
					could <pb n="26"

					/> never express, the repression of which was one of the forms of her
					âinsanity."</p>
				<p> Certain aspects of this productionâthe use of voices on tape, slides, lighting,
					the designed structures, objects of personal âritualâ created by the
					performersâare discussed in the direction notes and contributions by performers
					and designers printed in the appendix to the volume. These provide an integral,
					essential part of the text, outlining the difficult but rewarding practice of
					the performance, collective in every aspect from writing to staging to each
					performerâs self-direction.</p>
				<p> The historical text and the theatrical text were conceived interdependently.
					Although they are addressed to different, if overlapping, audiences and make
					different assumptions as textual mechanisms, they are not two distinct texts as
					would be, say, a biography and a play based on it. They are, rather, one set of
					raw materials examined with an identical ideological perspective and presented
					differently to achieve a double impact by juxtaposition; when we experience them
					together, the historical text has a distancing effect from the highly emotional
					impact of the dramatic text. The first is rational, documented, footnoted; the
					second is lyrical and intensely charged with emotion. The verbal material in the
					play is almost entirely from the original letters, with the addition of some
					contemporary poems and other quotations which serve as intertextual links to
					expand the historical resonance of the themes.</p>
				<p> The characteristic features of Cambriaâs entire work point to a new practice and
					vision of the relation between subject and modes of textual production.<note
						n="9" type="scholarNote">9. For the notion of modes of sign production see
						Umberto Eco, A Theory of Semiotics (Bloomington: Indiana University Press,
						1976) and Gianfranco Bettetini, Produzione del senso e messa in scena
						(Milano: Bompiani, 1975)</note> As for the form of content: historical, not
					mythical materials are chosen from a concrete situation and real events. These
					are not necessarily contemporary but always refer to the current concerns of the
						audience.<note n="10" type="scholarNote">10. In the words of Dacia Maraini,
						who reviewed Amore come rivoluzione, âbooks like this should be written by
						the hundreds. There are hundreds of extraordinary women who have so much to
						teach us (even if often they only speak of failures and defeat), women still
						buried under the barren, impious ashes of patriarchal history.â (Tuttolibri,
						17 aprile 1976, p. 4; my transla tion). The terms form of content and form
						of expression come from Louis Hjelmslev, Prolegomena to a Theory of Language
						(Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1961).</note> The historical events
					are examined in their socio-cultural complexity from the ideological and
					emotional viewpoints of contemporary feminism. The human sources of these
					viewsâwriters, performers and the specific audience addressed (this is a play
					for women)âare clearly identified to avoid mystification and mythologizing. As
					for the form of expression: the rejection of the novelistic as the single
					organizing principle of classical narrative forms like biography, romance or the
					ârealistâ novel must be seen in the light of current theories of the plurality
					of the text. This emphasizes the process of reading as a constitutive act of the
					subject. In this new textual form, where the rational historical inquiry is
					continually intersected by the lyrical and the personal, the subject is at once
					writer and reader, performer and audience. The resonance of the (documented)
					historical events in the subject is made possible by the âprivateâ dimension and
					in turn makes possible the emergence of pathos as a creative critical process.
					The text is produced as and meant to be received as the intersecting of the
					personal and the social, a process articulated dialectically on subjective codes
					and on objective realities.</p>
				<p> Working along these lines, we can perhaps develop a feminist theory of textual
					production which is neither a theory of womenâs writing nor just a theory of
					textuality. In other words, it is not a matter of finding common elements among
					the texts written or produced by women and defining them in terms of a presumed
					femaleness or femininity which, to my mind, is highly suspect of sexual
					metaphysics; rather, it is our task to envision a feminist theory of the process
					of textual production and consumption, which is of course inseparable from a
					theory of culture. In a recently translated article entitled âIs There a
					Feminine Aesthetic?â,Â  <persName>Silvia Bovenschen</persName> argues that there
					is no such thing as an ever-present female countercultureÂ as such, or a âfemale
					nature outside of historical development; and that to insist on such notions as
					irrational perception, cosmic powers or archetypal forms as categories for
					femaleness is at best playing menâs games, and at worst indulging in reactionary
						ideologies.<note n="11" type="scholarNote">11. Silvia Bovenschen, âIs There
						a Feminine Aesthetic?â, New German Critique, 10 (Winter 1977), pp. 111-137
						and Heresies f4, pp. 10-12. Altmanâs recent film, Three Women, seems to me
						to come close to the latter group.</note> Since it is the specifics of
					feminine experience and perception that determine the form the work takes, we
					must not accept a priori categories and should look for evidence of feminine
					sensitivity in concrete tests. It is good, Bovenschen claims, that no formal
					criteria for âfeminine artâ can be definitively laid down. This enables us to
					reject the notion of artistic norms and facile labeling, and prevents cooptation
					and further exploitation of womenâs creativity. So it is not a question of what
					or how women write, but of how women produce (as makers) and reproduce (as
					receivers) the aesthetic object, the text; in other words, we need a theory of
					culture with women as subjectsânot commodities but social beings producing and
					reproducing cultural products, transmitting and transforming cultural
						values.<note n="12" type="scholarNote">12. For a good analysis of womenâs
						position as objects of exchange in LÃ©vi Strauss and Freud/Lacan, see Gayle
						Rubin, âThe Traffic in Women: Notes on the Political Economy of Sex, in
